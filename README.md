# Creating a Stata project with automated Docker builds

[![Compute analysis](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/sample-project-stata/actions/workflows/compute.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/sample-project-stata/actions/workflows/compute.yml)

## Purpose

This repository serves as a demonstration  on how to use Docker together with Stata to 

a) encapsulate a project's computing for reliability and reproducibility and 
b) (optionally) leverage cloud resources to test that functionality every time a piece of code changes.

For all the details, see [https://github.com/AEADataEditor/stata-project-with-docker](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/stata-project-with-docker).
